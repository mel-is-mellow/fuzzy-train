<p class = "services">If you are a property manager or member of a board of a building cooperative and one of your shareholders wants to renovate their apartment,
    it’s always a good idea to get a third-party professional to review their architect’s proposed plans and scope of work to ensure that the proposed
    construction plan adheres to the highest industry standards and proper quality control is utilized.
    Each building and renovation is unique, and proper attention to detail now can avert complaints, disruption and property damage years into the future.</p>
