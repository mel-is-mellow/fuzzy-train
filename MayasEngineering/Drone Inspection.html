    Nothing can beat getting hands on and up close to inspect a building exterior.
    However, the costs and inconvenience to accomplish this task is high. One inspection can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
    It can take up to three weeks for the Department of Buildings to approve your paperwork.
    Contractors may need to bring heavy equipment through penthouse apartments and building lobbies.



    A drone inspection offers several advantages over traditional inspection methods:

    ​

    Inspection can be performed usually within 1 to 2 business days, compared to 5-15 business days with a traditional suspended scaffold.
    Inspection can be performed at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods.
    Drone inspections are less intrusive to the building and its inhabitants. No heavy equipment needs to be brought through the building or through apartment interiors.
    Hard-to-access areas become much easier to inspect.


    All drones are registered with the FAA and a qualified Remote Pilot in Command is licensed through FAA Part 107 certification.
    All high-resolution photo and video data is closely examined by a New York State Licensed Professional Engineer.

    ​
    NOTE: due to strict regulations regarding drone flight in and around NYC, this service may not be available in your area.
